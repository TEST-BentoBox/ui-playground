# How to install/run

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your system if you haven't already. You will need [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) as well.

Get the project code:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/TEST-BentoBox/ui-playground.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```console
$ cd ui-playground
```

Install the dependencies:
```console
$ npm install
```

Run the application:
```console
$ npm start
```

## Another option for playing without installing any software

Create an account at [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) (you can just use your GitHub account to create the account)

Then visit [https://codesandbox.io/s/github/uw-it-sis/ui-playground](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/uw-it-sis/ui-playground) which allows you to fork the project and run within your browser while also editing the code.
